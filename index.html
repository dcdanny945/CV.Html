    <h3 class="aboutme1">About Me</h3>   
    I am organized, punctual and an efficient communicator. I always want to learn new things and I am not afraid to face challenges.
        I am also a computer science graduate and keen to get into the industry.
        
        <p>I have passed CCNA and Red hat certificate in my time at Jinwen university. 
        When I moved to Australia in 2016, I didn’t speak much English and I could only find a job in hospitality, but now I think it’s time for me to revisit the IT industry. 
        I understand that IT is constantly changing and I am willing to work towards keeping my knowledge up to date. I am interested in web developing and developing my ability with JavaScript and Python.
